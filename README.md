The purpose of this code is to provide an easy way to calculate and visualise the splitter configuration required to create any split ratio in Satisfactory.

the program opens a commandline interface which asks the user for the required outputs.
These outputs should be provided separated by a comma. eg: 54,18,24
upon pressing enter, the program will calculate the required splitter configuration to achieve this split, and will use pyplot to make a visualisation.
